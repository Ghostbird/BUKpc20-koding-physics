# Godot Physics Engine tutorial

In this tutorial you're going to learn how to make use of the Godot physics engine to build a game while writing very little code. The physics engine is the part of Godot that makes a certain kind of objects behave according to the rules of physics in the game world. This enables us to make things fall down, and touch each other, without writing any code.

## Requirements

For this tutorial you need a computer with the Godot Engine installed. You can use the [Godot Engine on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/404790/Godot_Engine/), or you can download it directly from the [Godot website](https://godotengine.org/).

## Getting started

Next you're going to have to download this project's [start point](https://github.com/Ghostbird/BUKpc20-koding-physics/archive/0-getting-started.zip). Extract the ZIP somewhere on you computer.

Now open Godot and select `Import`. ![import instructions](docs/01-import.png)

Select the path where you extracted the ZIP, click the `project.godot`, then select `Import & Edit`.
